# Lab | Git

## Introduction

Being able to use both, git and GitHub, is an important skill every software/data engineer must possess.

This is even more important when it comes to its ability to handle code in collaborative projects. 

## Instructions


+ log into github on the browser using the account you set up during the pre work 
+ Create a new public repository in GitHub. Name it `Iron`+ your name. Example: if your name is _Alvaro_, you will name the repo `IronAlvaro`.
+ (optional) install gitkraken to track changes visually and open that repo on gitkraken
+ (optional) install github desktop and sign in to your github account 
+ Clone that repo to your computer.
+ Create a file in that folder. Name it `about.txt` and add a fun fact about yourself. (_You can use the command line: `touch nameOfTheFile.txt`_).
+ Add the file you just created to git.
+ Commit the change.
+ Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

Great! This was pretty smooth, we hope. :rocket:
